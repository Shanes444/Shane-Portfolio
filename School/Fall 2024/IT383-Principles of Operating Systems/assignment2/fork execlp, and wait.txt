In C, the fork() api works by doing a system call. This system call creates a child process from the parent
process(the original process) This child process is a copy of the parent process, and runs through the code
at the same time as the parent process. This essentially means that all of the code after the fork is being
executed twice (or more times if there are multiple forks). The wait() api does a wait system call for the
process. This means that the process will now wait for all of its children to finish executing before it
continues. Execlp() works by accessing the terminal and doing the given command. the first argument is the file path for the command, and the rest of the arguments make up the command.
