The execvp() api works by accessing the terminal so that it can enter commands. The first argument is the file
path for the command that is going to be called. The next argument is an array of strings, or char* as they 
are called in C. These char* make up the command that is going to be entered into the terminal. For example,
in my file execvp.c, the command being called is ls, so the array has "ls", and NULL.
